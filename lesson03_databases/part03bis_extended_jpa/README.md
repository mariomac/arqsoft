# Template for a Java Persistence API (JPA) project

This example project uses the [Java Persistence Api](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnbpz.html)
as an intermediate layer between your application and the database.

JPA is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool: it allows you working with relational databases (e.g.
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc...) directly with Java classes, helping you from creating a lot of
boilerplate code to read/write from/to the database, as well as having to deal with the subtle
differences between all the SQL dialects.

This example uses:

* Gradle as build system and dependency management.
* Hibernate as the JPA provider.
* H2 as embedded database.

Using Java embedded databases (H2, HSQLDB...) allows you easily test your SQL applications without
having to install and configure external services, such as MySQL or Postgres.

Thanks to JPA and Hibernate, you can later switch your database for production without having to
change a line of code (but the [persistence.xml](./src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml)
configuration).
